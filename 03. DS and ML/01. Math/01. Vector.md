## Attribute of Vector
```
- A vector is an object that has both a magnitude and a direction
- Vector can be 2D or 3D (X,Y,Z) axis and 
- i, j, k Rpresent unit vectors of (X,Y,Z) axis, that value is 1
- For dot product ( i.i = j.j = k.k = 1) ( Not same i.j or j.k or i.k = 0)
- For cross product ( ixi = jxj = kxk = 0 ) (ixj=k, jxk=i, kxi=j) (jxi=-k, kxj=-i, ixk=-j)

### 02. Unit Vector
A unit vector is a vector that has a magnitude (length) of exactly 1 and points in a specific direction.
```
- Magnitude is 1 and Indicates specific Direction
- Unit vectors are typically denoted with a "hat" symbol, ^
- Any non-zero vector can be converted into a unit vector in the same direction by dividing it by its magnitude: A^= A / ∣A∣
- Formula for a Unit Vector : if A=⟨a1,a2,a3⟩ unit vector in the direction of 𝐴 is:  [ A^= A / ∣A∣ = ⟨a1,a2,a3⟩ / root{( a1^2+a2^2+a3^2)} ]
- 2D Example: For  𝐴 = ⟨3,4⟩ 
                      Magnitude of A = root{3^2+4^2} = 5
                      Unit vector: A^ = 𝐴 / Magnitude = ⟨3,4⟩ / 5 = (3/5)(4/5)
- 3D Example: For  𝐴 = ⟨3,4, 5⟩ 
                      Magnitude of A = root{3^2+4^2} = 7.07
                      Unit vector: A^ = 𝐴 / Magnitude = ⟨3,4, 5⟩ / 7.07 = (3/7.07)(4/7.07)(5/7.07)

### 05. Dot Product (Scalar Product)

#### Characteristics:
```
- Scalar Result : It is a measure of how much one vector "projects" onto the other.
- If  𝐴 ⋅ 𝐵 > 0 : then θ is acute (less than 90°)
- If  𝐴 ⋅ 𝐵 = 0 : then θ = 90°
- If  𝐴 ⋅ 𝐵 < 0 : θ is acute (less than 90°)
- If θ = 0 : then vectors are parallel and point in the same direction. full magnitude
- If θ = 180 : then vectors are parallel anti parallel direction. Value will negative
- If θ = 360 : then vectors are parallel again..
- [ A.B = B.A ] , [ A⋅(B+C)=A⋅B+A⋅C ] , [ (kA)⋅B=k(A⋅B)  - k is a scalar. ] , [A⋅0=0], [B⋅0=0]
- Magnitude Formula A⋅A=∣A∣^2
- Angle Formula : cosθ= (A.B)/(∣A∣∣B∣)
- When tripple product -> A, B, C vectors example: [ A .(B x C )] result is scalar
- For dot product ( i.i = j.j = k.k = 1) ( Not same i.j or j.k or i.k = 0)
``` 

### 6. Cross Product (Vector Product)
![Cross Product](https://github.com/samratpro/Python_Notes/blob/master/03.%20DS%20and%20ML/01.%20Math/00.%20Img/01.%20vector/5.%20Cross%20Product.png)
#### Characteristics:
```
- Result is a Vector
- For cross product ( ixi = jxj = kxk = 0 ) (ixj=k, jxk=i, kxi=j) (jxi=-k, kxj=-i, ixk=-j)
- If θ=0 ∘ or 180∘,  sinθ=0, and the vectors are parallel or anti-parallel, so ∣𝐴×𝐵∣=0
- If θ=90∘, sinθ=1, and the magnitude is maximized: ∣𝐴×𝐵∣=∣𝐴∣∣𝐵∣
- Non-Commutative : A×B = −(B×A)
- Distributive : A×(B+C)=(A×B)+(A×C)
- The vectors are parallel or anti-parallel (θ=0 or 180).
- Direction (Right-Hand Rule) : A×B is determined by the right-hand rule:
                                Point the fingers of your right hand along 𝐴,
                                then curl them toward 𝐵. Your thumb points (👍) in the direction of 𝐴×𝐵
```
