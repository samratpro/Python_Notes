# Two way we can see Logs
## 1. Navigating File
`path is ' /base_path/logs/console.log ' `

Problem : Need to reload for update

Benefit : Easy to see by file navigation

## 2. Load in Terminal

`cd /base_path/logs/`

`tail -f console.log`

Problem : Command base navigation

Benefit : No need to reload for update
